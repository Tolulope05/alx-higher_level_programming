# Higher-level programming - Python

This repository contains programs written for the higher-level programming
track at ALX Africa. In these projects, which began occurring in month
four of the year one curriculum, I am currently learning Python.
Simultaneously, I continued to reinforce and expand my skills in C and shell
scripting. The specific list of projects contained follows:

* [0x00. Python - Hello, World](./0x00-python-hello_world)
* [0x01-python-if_else_loops_functions](./0x01-python-if_else_loops_functions)
